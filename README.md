Making Christopher Alexander and co's A Pattern Language accessible online.

Have loved Christopher Alexander and co's A Pattern Language for more than 20 years.

Would be amazing to have a decent online version with search, directory of patterns, linking, real text etc.

Using the physical book can be a bit painful trying to move between patterns or even find the page for a given pattern.
